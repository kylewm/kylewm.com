In a lot of ways email is a model for what the internet should
be. It's decentralized, ubiquitous, and resilient. There is no Email
Corporation that your friends and family members have to sign up
for. That sounds ridiculous to even say.

I remember being really excited about Google Wave, touted as "what
email would be if it had been invented now." I just blithely assumed
it would be interoperable with preexisting email protocols, why
wouldn't it? I figured that I'd start using Wave as my all-purpose
email client, and that it'd kick into supercharged mode when talking
to someone else who was also on Wave. Along with everyone else, when I
finally got into the beta, I sent a few messages to my other nerd
friends, and had no one else to talk to.

Eventually someone *is* going to come along and either reinvent email
or radically improve it. Reinventing is a lot more fun, and
potentially a lot more profitable, but I'm holding out hope for a more
evolutionary change.


## Running a server

This needs to be *a lot* easier. If you seek out expert advice on how
to set up a simple email server for small-scale personal use, that
advice generally seems to be "Don't". Right now email servers are
notoriously difficult to set up and maintain, and the cost of failure
is pretty grievous.

Sadly this means that email is becoming more and more centralized. And
at a certain point the gravitational pull of the big providers becomes
overwhelming... Say your indie domain gets marked as spam by Gmail
(for unknown reasons). Now you can't send messages to anyone
@gmail.com and you're kind of in trouble. I'm not saying that those
big guys are doing anything wrong or being purposefully
anti-competitive, but do we really want to give one or two so much
power that they can make other services irrelevant without even
trying?

I acknowledge that there are inherent difficulties in administrating a
server of any kind. I don't think this needs to be something an
average user does, but I also don't think it should cow professional
software engineers. I would love it if I could apt-get an email server
with sane defaults, SSL enabled, good basic spam filtering, twiddle a
few settings in /etc/mail.conf or whatever, and off you go. This thing
doesn't need to handle hundreds of users or high volumes of mail. I
think that would appeal to a lot of people. ([Mailpile][] promises all
this + dead-simple encryption).
