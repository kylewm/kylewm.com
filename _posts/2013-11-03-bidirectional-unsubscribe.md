Spam these days takes the form of things I ostensibly signed up for:
notifications, special sales, associate offers, weekly
updates. [Since 2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003),
marketing email is supposed to include an unsubscribe link that will
remove you from mailing lists within 10 business days, and it pretty
much does. In a lot of cases, they want you to click an unsubscribe
link and then type in your email address (or worse, log in to their
site) before changing complicated "preferences".

Generally these are companies or foundations or charities that I
*like*. I don't want to mark them as spam -- I just don't want to keep
getting ads for products that I already bought.

My ideal email client would have a one-click button to unsubscribe
from marketing emails from a particular sender. It would do the
marketer a favor of notifying them of the unsubscribe (so they don't
have to pay for whatever bandwidth they are using trying to send me
mail) and "unsubscribe" on the my side by adding a junk mail filter
for that sender. Maybe with some subtle way of letting me know in a
few weeks if I'm still getting messages from stuff I've ostensibly
unsubscribed from.
