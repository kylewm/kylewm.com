It sucks to admit this, but I have been spending a lot of mental
energy reflecting on my relationship with Facebook lately. In the
obnoxious world of tech investors, it was big news that teenagers have
been leaving FB for services 30-year-old-me has never heard
of. Apparently Facebook isn't cool anymore.

Honestly I don't think it was ever "cool". It always felt very
official... like a driver's license photo. I do remember wanting in
very badly until it finally came to Georgia Tech, and then being
excited when my girlfriend's little liberal arts college got it 6
months later, so I could go from "In a Relationship" to "In a
Relationship with" (sidenote: If you were in college ~2004, search
your old email for "thefacebook.com", it's a little bit amusing). But
much beyond that I don't remember ever being particularly excited
about it.

What it *has* been is, like Desmond Hume, a constant. And now with
family and friends on the other side of the country, it seems like an
outright necessity, like having a mailbox or a telephone, just a part
of daily life. I have unfriended people from high school I didn't know
well or don't want to know well now (which, I will admit, was *very*
satisfying) and hid people who posted distasteful stuff. And either
because of my whittling or their improved algorithms, there are hardly
ever stupid memes, chain letters, personality quizzes, or updates from
FarmVille-derivative games anymore. It really is relatively
interesting stuff from people I know in real life and care about. I
have gone from dreading seeing another baby picture to loving every
picture of my friends' two and three year olds, bundled up in the
snow, or dressed up for karate or ballet class. And don't get me
started on the cats.

**So why is it so goddamn depressing?**

Actually that's easy. It's because it trivializes relationships.

If you're using social media to coordinate, to invite people to
events, that's one thing. But as the primary mode of of communication
with a person/people you love, it is not OK. Humans aren't built for
that. We can go years without seeing each other, reunite over drinks
or coffee and spend hours catching up. There are supposed to be ups
and downs. We're not supposed to be just casual observers of each
other's lives (or at least the portion of our lives that are suitable
for sharing in a semi-public forum). Somehow it makes me feel even
farther removed. It dulls the bittersweet feeling of missing someone,
and dulls the excitement of reuniting with them.

And honestly it makes me jealous of vacations and parties and cute
kids and pets and lives presented as problem-free.

When I was younger, I worked three summers as a summer camp
counselor. Something about that experience, being away from home for
the first time, the constant close proximity to other counselors,
maybe the lack of sleep, creates the most intense-feeling
interpersonal bonds that I've maybe ever felt. One of the other
counselors was sort of a fixture at the camp, he had grown up there,
and everyone loved him... A total Christian summer camp rockstar. When
camp was over, the rest of us were promising to meet up during the
year, sure that we'd hang out all the time, obviously. But this guy
knew that the camp world and the non-camp world were separate, knew
that he was a different person outside, and that we probably wouldn't
see him. It seemed cold and bizarre at the time, but now I get
it. First loves, summer romances, people you looked up to, people who
shaped your personality or, more importantly, introduced you to good
music ...  Your heros, you're not supposed to see them get fat and
bald.
