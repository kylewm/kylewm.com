  <div id="about">
    <p>
      I am a software engineer and project manager in the SF Bay Area
      with 8+ years of professional experience. I have built and helped
      build several fielded applications, mostly in the area of highly
      constrained planning and scheduling. I work in Java and C++ but
      have a hobbyist's interest in almost every language I've come
      across.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also occasionally very excited about bicycling, photography,
      and vegetarian/vegan cooking.
